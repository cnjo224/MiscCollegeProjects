Description of Project:
This project uses the law of cosines to calculate the distance between two points
by using a common third point. The project also details converting between uncommon
units. By the law of cosines, the units must be the same, thus if they are not, the
code converts them into the same unit. After the calculations are complete, the
code will convert the answer into the desired units the user specified.

Questions:
 1)If a field is missing the code will recognize a conversion error and output an input
error statement. No other processes will be completed.

 2)If a field is blank, the cgi will throw an input error to the screen and quit.

 3)curl --data "distx=8&unitx=kilometer&disty=11&unity=kilometer&anglea=37&unita=radian&unitanswer=kilometer" http://www.cs.uky.edu/~cnjo224/CS316/P1_Jones/galactic_travel.cgi

 4)If a field value is too large, the program will output the answer as 'nan', which I
assume is a native error to cgi, because I didn't handle this case specifically.

 5)I would add approximately 50-100 additional lines of code to the galactic_travel.cgi
because my conversion factors are stored in a library. The form.html document would be
innumerably large and would honestly be reformatted to have text unit input instead
of drop down boxes that it currently boasts.
